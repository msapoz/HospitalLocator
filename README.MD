# iPhone Hospital Locator App

The Hospital Locator app displays health providers available around your current location based on data retrieved from the Google Maps API.  Additional filtering can be applied to select a search radius and choice of doctors and/or hospitals nearby, with their rating displayed in the annotation, if available.

## Installation

This project uses the Alamofire CocoaPod as specified [here](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) to make the REST calls to the API.
To run the project in xcode with the activated pod, run the generated HospitalLocator.xcworkspace file instead of HospitalLocator.xcodeproj.
